        "content": "<p>Sunita Devi, a 34-year-old mother of two from Balipatna village, struggled to make ends meet as a daily wage laborer. With an uncertain income and a family to support, she often faced days without enough food.</p><p>In 2018, NHRD organized a mobilization drive in her village, encouraging women to form Self-Help Groups (SHGs). Hesitant at first, Sunita joined the \"Maa Tarini SHG\" with 11 other women. Through the SHG, she received training in financial literacy and the importance of savings.</p><h3>The Turning Point</h3><p>After six months of regular savings, NHRD facilitated a bank linkage for her group. Sunita took a small loan of ₹20,000 to buy a cow. With the guidance of NHRD's livelihood experts, she learned about proper cattle care and dairy management.</p><p>Today, Sunita owns three cows and sells over 20 liters of milk daily to the local cooperative. Her monthly income has stabilized at around ₹8,000, allowing her to send both her children to the NHRD-supported school.</p><blockquote>\"I never thought I could be a business owner. NHRD didn't just give me money; they gave me the confidence to stand on my own feet.\"</blockquote>"

Rajan enrolled in the 45-day intensive course, where he learned technical skills, measurement, and safety standards.</p><h3>A New Foundation</h3><p>Armed with certification and a tool kit provided by NHRD, Rajan started taking up small independent contracts. His quality of work quickly earned him a reputation in Nimapara.</p><p>Now, at 28, Rajan employs four other youth from his village. He recently built a pucca house for his own parents, a dream he had cherished since childhood.</p>"

Priya excelled in her studies, showing a keen interest in science.</p><h3>Giving Back</h3><p>Supported by NHRD through college, Priya recently graduated with a B.Sc. in Physics. She is the first person in her entire extended family to hold a university degree.</p><p>Instead of taking a corporate job, Priya chose to return to LSE as a teacher. \"I want to be the light for other children, just as NHRD was for me,\" she says.</p>"

Yields were dropping, and debts were mounting due to the high cost of fertilizers.</p><p>NHRD's agricultural intervention program introduced Bimal to organic farming techniques. He learned composting, natural pest management, and crop rotation.</p><h3>Sustainable Growth</h3><p>The transition was challenging, but within two years, Bimal saw a remarkable turnaround. His input costs dropped by 60%, and the quality of his organic paddy fetched a premium price in the market.</p><p>Bimal is now a lead farmer in his community, training others in sustainable practices. \"We are not just growing crops; we are healing the earth,\" he proclaims proudly.</p>"
